New ideas have a multiplier effect unlike new widgets themselves or the capital which produces them. Ideas are said to bear <i>nonrivalry</i> – they are <i>infinitely usable</i> (Romer (1986), Jones (2021)). In the words of growth theorist Chad Jones, just “one new idea … can make any number of workers more productive” unlike even new widgets themselves which require more widgets to drive productivity among more workers (Jones (2021)). Ideas, that is, give rise to increasing returns to scale in production, from which output growth naturally follows. Productivity improvements – making more with less – mean we can meet basic necessities by expending less effort. In other, if not admittedly hand-wavy terms, productivity growth simply means things get better for people.

We will take them in turn. First, though: a review of imbalances.",
                    "I take it as somewhat given that international trade is beneficial and that so too are, to an extent, the trade and capital imbalances which inevitably result. Trade is per se beneficial in the Ricardian sense: It encourages specialization of production as defined by nation states’ comparative advantage – it doesn’t make sense, namely, for some countries to produce some things for others which it does, from which the exchange of goods and capital follows. So too with imbalances: The availability of export markets allows a country to employ a glut of domestically produced goods productively – it can sell them abroad – instead of leaving it for waste. In as much as some measure of excess production is inevitable, trade imbalances facilitate the globally beneficial rectification of domestic overproduction.",
                    "If exchange and imbalances up to a point are beneficial, artificially sustained persistent imbalances are not. This, on account of at least two definitional consequences: weak global demand and a global dearth of innovators. We begin with weak global demand.",

                            "Sustaining persistent imbalances necessarily is to sustain weak global demand. To lay this bare we should review how trade and capital imbalances are supposed to correct themselves.",
                            "Viewed from one – the surplus country’s – perspective, an imbalance forms when a country produces more goods and services than it can consume. Weak domestic demand relative to domestic production leads the country to sell the excess abroad, exporting goods in exchange for foreign capital; the country runs a surplus on the current account and sees net inflows, a deficit, on the capital account. The inflow of foreign capital makes the surplus country wealthier. Since every dollar must be either spent or saved, the country must necessarily either spend more domestically or export the capital-turned savings abroad. If it spends the capital domestically, it may do so in one of two ways: consumption or investment. Should it choose the former, the country’s previous gap between consumption and production, all other things equal, will narrow, and so too with it its current account surplus; the country need not anymore source demand abroad which it now finds at home. Should it choose to invest the capital domestically – in manufacturing, infrastructure, etc. – the country strengthens its domestic demand by boosting employment and consumption, from which, again other things equal, the current account surplus is similarly reduced. If, however, the country saves the foreign capital for export abroad – to purchase foreign financial assets, plants and equipment, or debt – it sees no reduction in the current account surplus. It has done nothing to strengthen domestic demand relative to production, from which a persistent current account surplus follows. The case of a persistent surplus, therefore, is one in which capital inflows are converted to a supply of savings beyond the domestic investment demand for those savings; a condition in which the initial capital inflows are not used to strengthen the country’s domestic economy; a condition in which savings for export are prioritized at the necessary expense of domestic demand, growth, and prosperity.",
                            "The case of a persistent surplus is not the natural one; imbalances are, in theory and to a first approximation, self-correcting. Temporary imbalances are globally uplifting as they foster global demand and specialized production. The persistent surplus, by contrast and as we have seen, definitionally reflects chronically weak surplus country domestic demand. To see weak demand as in fact a global condition – the first argued harm of persistent imbalances – we finally must consider the corresponding deficit country.",
                            "Because balances across the world must net to zero, the surplus countries’ current account surplus and capital account deficit are matched by the corresponding deficit country’s equal current account deficit and capital account surplus. The deficit country spends more than it consumes and exports more financial assets than it receives. On account of this excess consumption, at first blush it seems that global demand is no worse off under persistent imbalances: deficit country “strong” demand exactly offsets the surplus country’s weak demand. This is not so, however, because of the nature of the deficit country’s demand: It is necessarily debt-financed (by the surplus country’s savings) and by that fact fundamentally weak.",
                            "Therefore, and in sum, persistent imbalances leave surplus countries with definitionally weak and deficit country with unsustainable debt-financed demand. The upshot is weak demand across the globe as a whole.",

                            "Begin with growth theory: Recall Romer’s 1986 line, and the rephrasing from Jones:<blockquote>“Growth occurs because of innovation from private entrepreneurs, who are incentivized by the prospect of earning profits from their ideas” (Jones (2021)).</blockquote>The as-applied questions regarding how we get growth in society: What conditions give rise to that profits-incentivized ideation? To what extent are those conditions globally present? Interested in the impact of imbalances on long-run growth, we ask these questions of surplus and deficit countries in turn.",
                            "Take surplus countries first. We have seen these countries, by the persistence of imbalances, export weak domestic consumption to the rest of the world. By the very fact of wanting demand, they similarly deprive the world of potential innovators. That weak demand stems from necessarily low domestic consumption, itself the result of excessive domestic income inequality. Seeing inequality as the per se driver of the surplus country’s low consumption is easy. Inequality means the affluent capture a disproportionate share of national income. The degree of that disproportion determines the degree of inequality. The affluent, unlike a country’s poorer citizens, do not consume – they save – their income. A marginal increment of wealth for someone who has just enough goods to sustain herself is used to purchase more goods; a marginal increment of wealth for one who has more than enough is used to purchase financial assets. Low consumption in the surplus country is a condition of high saving; high saving is a condition of domestic income inequality.",
                            "Income inequality beyond a degree places downward pressure on profits-incentivized innovation, probably by many phenomena. I consider a direct, seemingly necessary one. High inequality reduces the gross number of potential entrepreneurs, that is, it leaves the country with a dearth of people searching for new ideas. Below some degree of needs-satisfaction – a condition of the less affluent in a society of high inequality – there is simply not the time, mental space, or ability otherwise to search for ideas. Searching for ideas, after all, is something of a luxury – a luxury which the surplus country’s high-saving and high-inequality prohibit.",
                            "Now consider deficit countries. They do not necessarily lack innovators as do their surplus country equivalents. But their deficits similarly place downward pressure on ideation, and in particular the productive variety. Unlike surplus countries, income inequality is not necessarily endemic, so a dearth of innovators need not follow. (Deficit countries, after all, have too much consumption – and by that fact, unsustainable demand – not too little.) Rather, deficit countries necessarily have corresponding capital account net inflows, and import the foreign glut of surplus country-produced goods. The former results in, at best, incentivization of speculative ideation, and at worst the fraudulent variety. The latter disincentivizes innovations to domestic supply-side production, as domestic industries are uncompetitive with artificially supported foreign production.",
                            "Consider the deficit countries’ capital inflows and the corresponding incentive to speculative ideation first. There exists, if history, at any rate, is to be the judge,<sup>[1]</sup> a limit to the amount of capital a country can productively make use of at any given time. Capital, of course, figures prominently in profits-incentivized innovation. This, in two senses. First, in the immediate term, capital directs the focus on ideation. Second, capital makes long-term profits-incentivization a reality. If capital is thus a boon to ideation, too rapid or voluminous of an influx of it – foreign savings, in this case of persistent deficit countries – instead results in unguided ideation, and the encouragement of the speculative, or worse fraudulent, search for knowledge. Classed together as unproductive more broadly, this is the first sense in which persistent imbalances, by way of definitionally persistent capital flows, hinder deficit country ideation.",
                            "And now consider the crowding out effect of foreign imports on deficit country ideation. Innovations to supply-side productivity are simply unnecessary, as the country offsets domestic production with foreign imports. Profit-seeking entrepreneurs are for this reason dissuaded from pursuing knowledge accumulation related to improving weakly productive domestic industries offset by foreign imports. One might object on the grounds that while the deficit country will not pursue knowledge accumulation, the surplus country, since it produces the good, will have the incentive to do so, and ideation across the world will be no worse off. This is not so. The surplus country produces the good expressly for the same reason it runs its surplus: Weak domestic consumption and high inequality mean that cheap labor facilitates easy output. If deficit countries lack the incentive to ideate because they simple lack industry at home, surplus countries lack the incentive by the very same reasons they maintain their current account surplus. Subdued ideation for the globe as a whole follows.",

            "Why does money have value? The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level offers an intuitive account: State-issued money is valuable because you have a tax liability to your government which you can only satisfy in the money that same government mints. Here I introduce Fiscal Theory using commonly accepted intuitions about our relation to the state as citizens of it.",
            "Explaining your relation to the state as a taxpaying citizen satisfying your tax burden in the state’s currency takes us a long way in understanding what sovereign currency is and isn’t. Those intuitions will eventually allow us to make strong claims about the tendency of the price level – the aggregated prices of an economy’s consumable goods and services – to rise and fall, i.e., the tendency of the government’s currency (and your tax burden, as we will see) to rise and fall relative to some basket of consumption. Let’s begin by exploring your relation to the state.",
            "We can simplify the society for ease. Imagine day zero of a society of one: You are the only citizen of the state. On day zero, the state prints some money – dollars, say – declares it currency, and hands the dollars to you. You can do many things with these dollars now in your possession, none of which are, to a first approximation, important to understanding their value. On day one, however, the state takes an action which is: It levies a tax, payable only in dollars.",
            "The state’s day one tax has fundamentally altered its relation to you, its citizen: you are no longer a mere citizen of it but a taxpaying one. What does that difference entail? The government has saddled you with a liability to it, in the dollar amount of its tax. A more thorough description: Since – let us stipulate – the government issues, along with the levy, a reasonable threat of punishment in the event of your failed payment, the magnitude of your liability is some combination of the anticipated harm you would suffer from the government’s punishment and the anticipated difficulty you will incur in amassing and subsequently parting with the tax-satisfying dollars. The upshot for your relation to your dollar holdings is clear: The tax burden has given your dollars value.",
            "This was recognized by, and the Fiscal Theory story begins with, Adam Smith:<blockquote>“A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money” - Wealth of Nations, Book II, Chapter II.</blockquote>",
            "Questions abound. What price dynamics follow? Why might the currency gain or lose value? Equivalently, why might prices relative to it rise or fall?",
            "Fiscal Theory’s story is simple: Raise the tax burden and the currency gains value. Lower the burden and it loses value. Price inflation – the devaluing of the currency relative to a basket of consumption – may follow from the government’s lessening of your tax burden. Price deflation – the appreciation of the currency relative to that basket of consumption – may follow from the burden’s increase.",
            "Fiscal Theory offers a more granular characterization of price dynamics. Before we get there, let’s take stock of these simplified dynamics, assessing whether they jibe with intuitions about taxes, spending, and inflation. The conventional wisdom says higher taxes, other things equal, are deflationary and lower taxes – or higher relative spending, as the case may be – inflationary. Fiscal Theory concurs. By the conventional wisdom and that of Fiscal Theory, if the government comes along and on net adds to your stock of wealth, you’re going to spend more, and prices will rise. By contrast, if it, by more taxes or less spending, reduces your net wealth, you spend less, and prices fall. Fiscal Theory agrees with the conventional wisdom on the direction of price responses to government’s fiscal posture.",
            "Now in detail. The questions we must now answer is <i>why</i> and <i>how much</i> the price level rises or falls in response to the government’s actions. For this, Fiscal Theory offers an identity: <i>The price level adjusts to set the real value of government debt equal to the present value of the government’s primary budget surpluses.</i>",
            "A mouthful perhaps, but straightforward. Most governments issue two kinds of debt – money and bonds. (Greenbacks – money, currency, reserves, i.e. – are liabilities of the U.S. government; just look at ‘Federal Reserve Note’ inscribed at the top of any bill.) The real value of a government’s debt is the inflation-adjusted present value of future cash flows where the cash flows are primary surpluses. Budget surpluses – or deficits, as the case may be – come from tax and spend decisions. As the government increases the tax burden on the public, surpluses rise; as the tax burden falls, as do surpluses. Throughout, Fiscal Theory offers that <i>the price level rises or falls – that is inflation or deflation emerges – such that the real value of debt equals the present value – the expected sum of discounted cash flows – of surpluses.</i>",
            "Returning to our simplified one-person society lays bare this ‘why.’ Suppose Uncle Sam, on day one but after levying the tax, delivers you a windfall in the form of a lower tax burden, i.e., more spending relative to taxes. Uncle Sam may finance the relative revenue shortfall by printing money or issuing bonds. In either case, in Fiscal Theory, this wealth effect leads you to spend,<sup>[2]</sup> driving up prices – and devaluing the new outstanding debt – be it money or bonds – relative to lower relative surpluses. By contrast, should Uncle Sam deliver a net loss to your wealth surpluses will definitionally rise, and with them real value of the government’s debt as you spend less and the price level falls.",
            "The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level is as simple as it is elegant. Prices adjust to value outstanding government debt at the expected sum of discounted surpluses. A government which adopts a hawkish posture leaves its citizens with an increased tax burden, payable in its currency, from which the same’s appreciation follows. By the same logic, a dovish stance lessens the tax burden, depreciating the currency and causing inflation. ",
            "At its heart, Fiscal Theory is a backing theory of money, a gold standard, if you will, without the gold. Just as, under that order, a government’s “full faith and credit” lies in its commitment to this backing – its promise was to amass gold reserves upon redemption – and so too a stable currency and price level, fiat currency is similarly backed by a promise to amass resources – surpluses from taxes. Frankly – and it may be Fiscal Theory’s most important upshot – surprisingly little has changed."

Second, imbalances are especially disadvantageous, even if not commonly seen as so, for countries which run persistent trade deficits. Third, imbalances are harmful to certain constituencies in surplus countries, namely workers as they are paid less than the value of what they produce. Fourth and most importantly, imbalances deliver windfalls, but probably only so in the short-term, for global asset holders.",
            "But from a short-sighted perspective of asset owners, rectifying these imbalances seems desirable. Questions emerge. What policies are best suited to the task? Should the burden fall on surplus or deficit countries? What political barriers stand in the way?",
            "Today’s imbalances proximally stem from action on the capital account. Trade imbalances have been caused by the export of savings from countries which run current account surpluses – those which produce more than they consume – to those which run corresponding current account deficits – those which spend more than they produce. Saving, which for myriad reasons is higher than domestic investment capacity, functionally requires surplus countries to export savings abroad in search of returns. The result has been imbalanced trade as deficit countries are forced to spend more than they produce, financed by the imported surplus country savings.",
            "A tax or other barrier on capital imports enacted by deficit countries has been floated as a remedy (Pettis (2019)). Such restrictions would be enacted by deficit countries to force an immediate reduction in surplus countries’ saving-investment gap. No longer able to export savings in search of returns abroad, surplus countries would be forced to do one of two things: they could finance more domestic investment or save less of their income. The former is unlikely ex ante. High-saving surplus countries only export savings once they have satisfied their necessarily finite domestic investment capacity. Disallowing saving exports to deficit countries would instead force domestic political changes with the upshot of redistributing income to workers who will consume their income and who are presently underpaid relative to what they produce. Surplus countries would be forced in effect to strengthen their fundamentally weak domestic demand, which they presently export to the world in the form of savings on the capital account and a glut of goods on the current account.",

This, because such restrictions would rapidly correct the rampant asset price inflation these imbalances have, now for years, helped cause.",

I think not. High-savings surplus countries after all must necessarily reach for yield abroad, purchasing increasingly risky deficit country financial assets, with the result of bidding up prices.",

Should those populists movements grow and, critically, get serious about implementing protectionist policies, perhaps capital barriers, as a part of a broader protectionist deficit country trade stance are – for better and for worse – in our global future.",

Importantly, in my view these harms offset the benefits consumers in deficit countries derive from cheaper goods, probably the chiefly cited argument for sustained global imbalances. Third, most obviously imbalances acutely detriment workers in surplus countries, as they are necessarily underpaid for the fruits of their labor, and surplus countries more broadly which have historically poor track records of making the eventual transition from industrializing to industrialized nations which imbalances require. Fourth, imbalances are beneficial for – and pretty much only for – elites (wealth asset holders and corporations) in surplus and deficit countries, as they have benefitted from asset price inflation these imbalances have helped cause, and globalized capital in general.

    //                 "First, consider the claim that imbalances lower global demand. A country must save or consume every dollar of its income. If a country consumes less than it saves – i.e., it is a net saver – it must do one of two things with the saving excess: it may use those savings to invest at home – in plants, manufacturing equipment, infrastructure, etc., all of which drive employment and domestic demand – or export the savings abroad. Naturally, every country at any point in history has a certain amount of investment capacity and therefore a corresponding ability to absorb savings. Beyond a point, of course, there are only so many roads, bridges, and plants that you can reasonably build. If a country saves more than it consumes, and those savings are higher than can be used to fund domestic investment, the country must send its savings abroad – it must run a capital account deficit as it exports more savings than it imports. Those savings facilitate cheap borrowing in the capital-recipient, the current account deficit, country.",
    //                 "By the balance of payments (a capital account deficit is matched by an equal and opposite current account surplus), the country runs a current account surplus by definition equal to the gap between its saving and investments. And by running a current account surplus, the country produces more than it consumes – its demand is weak relative to its production; it exports this weakness to the rest of the world.",
    //                 "Since trade must net out across the entire global economy, for every country running a current account surplus, there is one running an equivalent current account deficit.<sup>[1]</sup> To see the effect of the surplus countries’ weak demand on global demand, consider the current account dynamics in the corresponding (trade) deficit country. By running a current account deficit, this country imports more than it exports, equivalent to consuming more than it produces. It finances this excess spending with asset sales to and borrowing from foreigners. Critically, the deficit countries spending – which, to be clear, makes up for the surplus country’s low consumption and weak domestic demand – is debt-financed. It is fundamentally unsustainable domestic demand for the deficit country and correspondingly unsustainable foreign demand for the matching surplus country. The upshot: Else equal, compared to the world without these imbalances – one in which the surplus country can consume what it produces, global demand is weak debt-financed.",

Foreign exports are in fact cheap, both absolutely because of comparatively cheap labor in surplus countries, and favorable exchange rates encouraged by surplus countries’ capital exports. In theory that allows consumers to gain marginal utility while incurring a lower cost of consumption. Indeed, the cheap acquisition of marginal utility for deficit country consumers is a benefit of trade imbalances.",
    //                 "There are, however, high prices deficit countries pay for sustained imbalances. First, the “cheap” consumption is fundamentally unsustainable; it is debt-financed. Second and more importantly, the country’s demand – even if propped up by foreign saving inflows – is weak relative to what it could be. A blighted manufacturing sector, and blighted regions which once housed the same obviously means depressed exports, but it also means foregone domestic consumption of domestically produced goods on the part of those would-be export earners. Third, rapid capital inflows have a terrible tendency to distort economies, transitioning entire societies from industrial capitalist to financial capitalist orders. That transition may not alone be a bad one. In as much as it’s fueled by, foundational for, or encouraging of rampant financial speculation, however, – which, to be clear, has and continues to characterize dynamics in nearly every Anglo-American asset class for the past 30 years – it is. Finally, the growth resulting from debt-fueled consumption of cheap goods cannot be reasonably said to be high quality, at least in comparison to that which is derived from consumption and production of genuinely novel widgets and methods of producing them. The conventional wisdom may lead one to recoil from judging the objects of consumption.<sup>[4]</sup> In my appraisal, it is beyond reasonable to compare genuine growth from supply-side improvements with that derived from the debt-financed consumption of cheap gadgets.",

On which can it sustainably in the long run? A once in a century proliferation of populism and what seems to be genuinely unique discontent in these same countries suggest a certain answer to that question.

Regressive taxation and subsidization – with currency manipulation or government incentives to private sector businesses – engender this inequality, perhaps purposefully, to push up the country’s savings rate.

And globalized capital – their ability to send that extra share of income abroad in light of insufficient investment absorption at home – has allowed them to capture returns capital export. Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, work has been done to explore the historical record on surplus countries’ investments performance – and the results are striking. Klein and Pettis (2020) tell of the remarkably poor track record of German lending and investment abroad, a record so poor that they point out that ex post it would have behooved those German investors to keep their money at home.

The presence of the world’s most developed capital markets, and the position of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency attracts remarkable capital flows to U.S. debt, equity, and real estate markets, not to mention the U.S. Treasury market in particular. The insatiable demand for U.S. government debt is supported by foreign savings; indeed, bond prices took off right as did globalized capital and trade. This pushed real interest rate to historically unprecedented lows, delivering further gains across asset classes.
